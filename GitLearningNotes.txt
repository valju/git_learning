			GIT LEARNING NOTES 2020
                        =======================

RCS was created in 1982, CVS was released in 1990, Subversion was released in 2000, and Git was initially released in 2005

git add -i   // for interactive choosing of files to stage, 
git add -u   // to update only files already known to git

git rm myfile // from wd and index
git rm myfile --cached   //.from wd and staged changes

git mv   // better than remove and add

trees - blobs - commits (- tags optionally, human-friendly names of project history moments)

the index contains a complete picture of the state of a project at a given time

file(s) is added as blobs to the object store and adds references to the new blobs in the index, by sha1 hash

HEAD in the current branch points to new commit object after commit

160-bit 40-character hexadecimal sha1 hash value, or use first six characters =already 16^6=> 1/16.77 million chance of clashes. "so that the reference is unique"

git status

git diff // to see the differences between your working project files and what is in the repository.
// BETTER? will show all differences between your staged working directories and what has been previously committed
git diff --cached earlier_commit_name
git diff one_commit another_commit

git ls-files --others --exclude-standard

git log | grep "^commit" | head -10

git blame -L 3107,3121 kernel/sched/core.c

diff -r my_cvs_repo diffutils/
Only in diffutils/: CVS
Only in my_cvs_repo: .git

---------

forking - git clone
branching - git checkout -b newbranch
or
git branch work  // creates a new branched copy of current branch, but stays on current branch
git branch -d work

git show-branch
git branch
------

git tag     //creates a tag or annotated tag (a text string that references a commit object). The tag is placed in .git/refs/tags unless it is an annotated tag, in which case, the tag is created as an object in the object store (changes induced by git tag):

.gitignore

There can be .gitignore files in each subdirectory, with rules applying recursively and thus incrementally

*.ko                  # normally ignore .ko files,
!my_driver.ko         # but override that and include my_driver.ko to repository
OR: When you commit, you'll have to use a "-f" option to explicitly force that file to be added. So, that's a little bit about how git classifies files.

---
$ git bisect start
$ git bisect bad
$ git bisect good V_10
..git bisect good/bad until you find the bug, then   
git bisect reset

OR: git bisect run ./myscript.sh 

You can replay the bisection history with git bisect log or git bisect visualize
- - -
git show sprint2:src/myfile.js
git checkout sprint2 src/myfile.js

git revert commit_name  // if risk someone else pulled
git reset --hard HEAD~2        // if working alone

git restore // You can easily remove all the working files in your project, and then just simply restore them with a "git restore" command just totally from that .git directory.

REBASING https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#using-git-rebase 
, first with more tradional = merge
o--o--O--o--o--o <-- origin
        \        \
         a--b--c--m <-- mywork

... second IF we use rebasing instead:   git rebase origin
o--o--O--o--o--o <-- origin
                 \
                  a'--b'--c' <-- mywork

git checkout -b development origin  // Here development is a lone coders private branch!!
git checkout development
git rebase master development   // Rebasing 'merges' but looses history of the dev branch
...solve conflicts...
...add changed files...
git rebase --continue    OR    git rebase --abort
---
Conflict resolution:
a) modify the conflicting files and commit once again.
b) git reset and modify either branch
---
SHELL SCRIPT EXAMPLES
n=0
while [ $n -lt 5 ] ; do
    n=$(($n+1))
    file=file$n
    echo file > $file
    if [ "$n" == "4" ] ; then 
	echo BAD >> $file  
    fi
    echo I created file: $file , if it was 4th one, it has text line BAD added to it.

bare repository? Are e.g. BitBucket and GitHub repos bare repositories? Seems so, as push should be only able to a bare repository. (((Though people can (maybe shouldn't, but can) edit locally in GitHub too. MAybe GitHub offers access straight to repo index and not to working files?)))

--

BEWARE: Cloning local repository might lead git using hard links instead of duplicating data (to save disk space). That's good and bad news.  use the --no-hardlinks option if wish totally separate folders.

Gerrit review layer before change to upstream:  -2, -1, +1, +2     (No -2 and needs at least one +2)
 Git + merit = Gerrit?
